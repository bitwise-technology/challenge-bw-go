# challenge-bw-go

This challenge was created to encourage the learning of the programming language in GO.

The challenge is to create a project of your own and that you like, containing the following elements: 

- Value and Reference Types (Know at last the difference between them, golang is full of surprises)
- Control flow (like conditionals, loops e etc..)
- Structs
- Functions
- Pointers
- Concurrency or Parallelism
- Error handling
- Documentation with [swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger)
- Pure Unit tests
- Add CI and CD to your project using Github Actions
- Deploy the swagger and the API to any cloud service you want
- Feel free to build anything you want on Go 


# Rules

## #1 You don't need it! Don't go to StackOverflow!!!
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/IRkqguqMTKUne/giphy.gif)
- Please know how and why you are doing stuff on GOlang, use the [documentationns](https://golang.org/doc/) and the code [proposals](https://github.com/golang/proposal) to understand what you're doing, like how packages works or why go does not have reference types e etc..

## #2 Respects the language rules, install Go linter to help you

## #3 Instead of break the Rule #1, ask your friends for help. We will be glad to assist you!
